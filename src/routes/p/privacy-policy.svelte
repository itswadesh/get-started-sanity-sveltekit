					feature, please read the note below :
				</p>

				<p class="mb-5 text-sm">

					network who have rated establishments and/or are users of AtoZ Cambodia Services. AtoZ
					Cambodia collects ratings in the following ways :
				</p>

				<ul class="ml-4 flex list-disc flex-col gap-5 text-sm">

				<h1 class="mb-5 font-semibold">Benefits</h1>

				<p class="mb-5 text-sm">
					Your contacts list will allow AtoZ Cambodia to provide you with ratings given by your
					friends and help make the experience on AtoZ Cambodia even better. Your friends' ratings
					will allow you to make a better decision about choosing a product/service/establishment in

				<h1 class="mb-5 font-semibold">How AtoZ Cambodia uses your information</h1>

				<p class="mb-5 text-sm">
					AtoZ Cambodia "tags" the contacts in your address book as your friends, but at anytime,
					you can review the list of your tagged friends and choose to untag any of them at any
					time. Untagging your contacts will hide your ratings from them and will also result in
					their ratings not being shown to you.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-5 text-sm">
					Only users of AtoZ Cambodia will be displayed in your tagged friends list. If a contact in
					your address book has rated an establishment/s on AtoZ Cambodia, the ratings associated
					with the contact will be displayed as part of your friends' ratings. If a contact in your
					address book has used AtoZ Cambodia's service across any platform and has not rated an
					establishment, although their name is displayed in your friends list, no ratings will be
					shown associated with the said contact.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-5 text-sm">
					If any of your tagged friends registers with our Service across AtoZ Cambodia's platforms,
					ratings of such a friend will be visible to you only if
				</p>

				<ul class="ml-4 flex list-disc flex-col gap-5 text-sm">
					<li>Your mobile number is present in his contacts list</li>

					<li>You have not been untagged by your friend</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="mb-5 text-sm">
					AtoZ Cambodia will also provide users with a privacy settings option that will allow the
					user to choose appropriate privacy levels. By default, the user's contact list will be
					used to identify friends in the network. A user may choose to allow anyone to tag him/her
					as a friend and may also choose to allow nobody to tag him/her as a friend.
